The architecture of this project involves several key technologies. The frontend was developed using Next.js, a popular React framework that enables server-side rendering and automatic code splitting. This helps to optimize the performance of the application by reducing the load time and improving the user experience.

The project was deployed using Vercel, a cloud platform for static and serverless websites. This platform provides a fast and scalable infrastructure for hosting the application, as well as continuous integration and deployment capabilities.

Finally, the project utilizes Electron as a webview to create a desktop application with web technologies. Electron allows developers to build cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This architecture provides a solid foundation for building modern, high-performance web applications that can be easily deployed and accessed across a variety of platforms.
