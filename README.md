### Next.js

The frontend was developed using Next.js, a popular React framework that enables server-side rendering and automatic code splitting. This helps to optimize the performance of the application by reducing the load time and improving the user experience.

### Vercel

The project was deployed using Vercel, a cloud platform for static and serverless websites. This platform provides a fast and scalable infrastructure for hosting the application, as well as continuous integration and deployment capabilities.

### Electron

Finally, the project utilizes Electron as a webview to create a desktop application with web technologies. Electron allows developers to build cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
